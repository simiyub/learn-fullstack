# learn-fullstack gives you an opportunity to build an application and learn the lifecycle of an application including:
 - design 
 - development
 - testing
 - continuously integration
 - continuous deployment into a container

In the process you will learn how to work with different programming languages to deliver a product.

The initial design and architecture includes:
 - bank-account - a spring boot java application that offers basic banking services.
 - loan-account - a python application that offers loan services to bank account holders.
 - bank-ui - a react ui that can be used to access both the bank account and the loan account.
 - a node.js server that runs the bank services.

This will develop as we go along

We the github workflow as our branching strategy here with main > release > integration and feature branches.
