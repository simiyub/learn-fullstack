# learn-fullstack
learn fullstack is an opportunity to build an application that demonstrates the:
 - design 
 - development and testing
 - continuous integration
 - continuous deployment into a container
The demo is not limited to one programming language rather will demonstrate the development process through a variety of languages.

The initial design and architecture includes:
 - bank-account - a spring boot java application that offers basic banking services.
 - loan-account - a python application that offers loan services to bank account holders.
 - bank-ui - a react ui that can be used to access both the bank account and the loan account.
 - a node.js server that runs the bank services.
